# Mobile Apps with Drupal

## DrupalCampMA 2013

This session will touch on many different ways you can achieve mobile experiences with Drupal. But the focus will be on building out an iOS app with Apache Cordova and Drupal.

In this session I'll cover:

- Benefits/Caveats of each way you can provide a mobile experience
- Apache Cordova (formerly Phonegap), her features, and the gotchas
- Drupal paired with the Services module
- Walkthrough of how to build a simple Drupal/Cordova app

No Xcode experience necessary, but you should however be familiar with Drupal & jQuery.
